# Spring Training 

No, this doesn't have anything to do with baseball. This is a project I used to dive into a more modern version of the `Java` framework `Spring` than existed when I last coded professional in 2010. 

IIR, I used some sample projects from the both [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) and the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework#learn).

I also followed this course from [The Practical Developer](https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/full-reactive-stack-1-intro/)

I didn't go too far into this because I ended up working in `PHP` and then `Ruby on Rails` instead of `Java` but still a good learning experience diving into a modern framework.
